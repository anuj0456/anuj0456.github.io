The correct translation for “sauerkraut” is simply “choucroute.”Training CutoffThe model’s training only includes data up to a certain point (e.g., GPT-4’s training cutoff in September 2021), missing out on more recent developments and information.Example:Prompt: “Who is the current president of the United States?”Response: “As of my last training data in September 2021, the president is Joe Biden.”Correction: Always clarify the model’s training cutoff date in prompts or look up recent information manually.Model Architecture LimitationsThe inherent design and limitations of the model architecture can contribute to the generation of hallucinated content. Despite advances, LLMs may still lack the ability to fully understand complex human languages and contexts.In Part 2, we will explore a range of techniques to mitigate hallucinations in large language models, ensuring their outputs are more accurate and reliable. This includes clarifying context, reducing ambiguity, refining prompts, using external verification, updating training data, improving tokenization, and regular monitoring and fine-tuning.Part2: https://medium.com/@anuj0456/decoding-hallucinations-in-llm-causes-and-solutions-part-2-cae2c0c146fb]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The REAL Advance RAG with Images and Tables</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/06/08/the-real-advance-rag-with-images-and-tables.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The REAL Advance RAG with Images and Tables" /><published>2024-06-08T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2024-06-08T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2024/06/08/the-real-advance-rag-with-images-and-tables</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2024/06/08/the-real-advance-rag-with-images-and-tables.html"><![CDATA[<div class="medium-feed-item"><p class="medium-feed-image"><a href="https://medium.com/@anuj0456/the-real-advance-rag-with-images-and-tables-93ad0d1e16cb?source=rss-d2453bdab35d------2"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1920/0*TC3NJmIn5M9chPjt.jpg" width="1920"></a></p><p class="medium-feed-snippet">In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), the integration of images and tables into text has been a longstanding challenge&#x2026;</p><p class="medium-feed-link"><a href="https://medium.com/@anuj0456/the-real-advance-rag-with-images-and-tables-93ad0d1e16cb?source=rss-d2453bdab35d------2">Continue reading on Medium »</a></p></div>]]></content><author><name>Anuj Gupta</name><email>anuj0456@gmail.com</email></author><category term="image" /><category term="advance-rag" /><category term="llm" /><category term="langchain" /><category term="table" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the realm of natural language processing (NLP), the integration of images and tables into text has been a longstanding challenge&#x2026;Continue reading on Medium »]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Incomplete context in RAG</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2024/05/13/the-incomplete-context-in-rag.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Incomplete context in RAG" /><published>2024-05-13T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2024-05-13T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2024/05/13/the-incomplete-context-in-rag</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2024/05/13/the-incomplete-context-in-rag.html"><![CDATA[<div class="medium-feed-item"><p class="medium-feed-image"><a href="https://medium.com/@anuj0456/the-incomplete-context-in-rag-479e1cd9c15a?source=rss-d2453bdab35d------2"><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/762/0*pwQqr6PUdicw_XfJ.png" width="762"></a></p><p class="medium-feed-snippet">Introduction: In the realm of AI and natural language processing (NLP), context is king.

AI has made significant achievements in NLP, improving our ability to understand, analyze, and generate natural language. Since the invention of transformers, we have witnessed a very fast acceleration of the pace of development in the past decade.

The former is referred to as psychological creativity (shortened as P-creativity), whereas the latter as historical creativity (shortened as H-creativity) (Boden, 2003). While the difference appears negligible, it is substantial when discussing LLMs in general. Considering these definitions, a model writing a text that is not in its training set would be considered as P-novel, but possibly also H-novel, since LLMs are commonly trained on all available data. Their stochastic nature and the variety of prompts that are usually provided commonly lead to novel outcomes (McCoy et al., 2021); LLMs may therefore be capable of generating artifacts that are also new. However, one should remember how such models learn and generate. Even if prompted with the sentence “I wrote a new poem this morning:”, they would complete it with what is most likely to follow such words, e.g., something close to what others have written in the past (Shanahan, 2022). It is a probabilistic process after all. The degree of dissimilarity would therefore be small by design. High values of novelty would be caused either by accidental, out-of-distribution productions, or by a careful prompting, i.e., one that would place the LLM in a completely unusual or unexpected (i.e., novel) situation.</p><p>Surprise instead refers to how much a stimulus disagrees with expectation (Berlyne, 1971). It is possible to identify three kinds of surprise, which correspond to three different forms of creativity. Combinatorial creativity involves making unfamiliar combinations of familiar ideas. Exploratory creativity requires finding new, unexplored solutions inside the current style of thinking. Transformational creativity is related to changing the current style of thinking (Boden, 2003). These three different forms of creativity involve surprise at increasing levels of abstraction: combining existing elements, exploring for new elements coherent with the current state of the field, and transforming the state of the field so as to introduce other elements. The autoregressive nature of classic LLMs make them unlikely to generate surprising products (Bunescu and Uduehi, 2019), since they are essentially trained to follow the current data distribution (Shanahan, 2022). By relying only on given distributions and being trained on them, LLMs might at most express combinatorial creativity. Of course, specific different solutions may be generated by means of prompting or conditioning. For instance, recent LLMs are able to write poems about mathematical theories, a skill that requires the application of a certain existing style to a given topic, yet leading to new and unexplored solutions. However, the result would hardly be unexpected for whom has prompted the text. For an external reader, the surprise would probably come by the idea of mathematical theories in verses, which is due to the user (or by the initial astonishment of a machine capable of it (Waite, 2019)). Transformational creativity is not achievable by means of the current LLM training solutions.</p><p><strong>In conclusion, while LLMs are capable of producing artifacts that are valuable, achieving novelty and surprise appears to be more challenging as their inner autoregressive nature seems to prevent them from reaching transformational creativity.</strong></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=65ce584b6af" width="1" height="1" alt="">]]></content><author><name>Anuj Gupta</name><email>anuj0456@gmail.com</email></author><category term="machine-learning" /><category term="ai" /><category term="chatgpt" /><category term="future-technology" /><category term="nlp" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Language plays an important role in our lives and that is why NLP(Natural Language Processing) has been a very important branch of AI.
